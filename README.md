BCPM0073: BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING II 
1. Introduction:
This document includes important information regarding your summative assessment. Please read this document in full and refer to it while preparing your assignment.
Please note that this is a INDIVIDUAL coursework, with individual submission at the end.
2. Assessment Brief: 
Introduction 
This assignment requires to assess the building services requirements of a given building and to propose appropriate services systems and solutions. Each student has been allocated a building to design its services systems, as indicated below.
You are asked to use the building services principles outlined through Building Services I and II courses and your own notes, reading and research, to develop a System Proposal for your case study building. It will be necessary to assess the specific needs of your case study building, and to consider which services will be most appropriate. It is important to give authority to your work by using your lecture notes, current legislation, research and good practice, and referring to standard methods and data. The design documents will be the case study building type, in the form. of freehand sketches drawn by the Architect on a restaurant napkin, together with some more detailed instructions. Current architectural design has limited consideration in Façade Optimisation, so your design should consider the façade improvement, e.g. window area, shading devices, when needed.
Although you only need to focus on some systems listed below, your work must also consider the relationships between the various engineering disciplines (i.e. interdisciplinary consideration). The Architects’ sketches do not include stairs, lifts  escalators, riser ducts, toilets or plant areas. You must decide the size, number and location of these, very early in the design programme and incorporate them into your unidisciplinary design. Additionally, you should select the Location of the building (within England) to provide references to the system selection. The location selected should require both heating and cooling for the building.
Requirements 
The following tasks should be covered in this d代 写BCPM0073: BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING IIPython
代做程序编程语言esign project, including approximate plant room size and location.
1. Cooling + Ventilation + Façade Optimization
2. Heating + Ventilation + Façade Optimization
3. Electrical Power  Cable Distribution
4. Lighting + Façade Optimization
5. Water Services (Hot and Cold)
6. Drainage (Soil  Waste + Rain Water)
You can select either Task 1, or Task 2, or a combination of Tasks 3 and 4, or a combination of Tasks 5 and 6. The tasks are arranged in related pairs and you are NOT at liberty to change the combination.
For your final submission, please DO CHECK the Resolution, especially design drawings, to make sure the contents in your report can be seen clearly by the markers.
The report shall expand on the topics and shall include system selection criteria; relevant design drawings; relevant research; current installation techniques and references. You are expected to analyse the building conditions, develop your analysis to arrive at a suitable services solution, justify your proposals and show how your proposals link with other services and fit into the building. Detailed plant, distribution and equipment sizes, however, are NOT required.
Your analysis shall deal with the impact of the proposals on the building, relevant legislation, sustainability issues, etc. Plant room locations and their approximate sizes are required, together with main distribution routes and risers for each group of services.
The 3R’s – rooms, routes  risers – shall be shown for each task. 
3. Use of AI: 
The following category of AI can/cannot be used:
Category 1 – AI cannot be used.
X Category 2 – AI tools can be used in an assistive role.
Category 3 – AI has an integral role.
For examples of each category please go to Using AI tools in assessment
Category 2 - Students are permitted to use AI tools for specific defined processes to support the development of specific skills as required by the assessment, such as data analysis, transcription, and translation, generating insights, giving feedback on content, or proofreading content.
Students must acknowledge where they have used AI within their coursework.
